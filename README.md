VERSION CONTROL - is a tech pattern used to create record changes made on files especially source codes of a program or project.
This is to enables the person or people involved in such project to track the changes made to it and easily restore a particular point. This also helps in collaborative work where a team is working on a particular project.
Version control is more like a back-up of an ongoing project.

Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that is used for tracking changes in source code during software development, while Github is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration using Git and provides a hosting service for software development projects, allowing developers to store and manage their code repositories in the Git format.
